In this project, we utilized the Pandas Library to combine and analyze open datasets from NYC's various agencies. My group chose the Housing Maintenance Code Violations from the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD). HPD issues violations against conditions, in rental dwelling units and buildings that violate New York City's Housing Maintenance Code (HMC) or the New York State Multiple Dwelling Law (MDL). 

Violation data is updated daily. Each row in the dataset contains discrete information about one violation that potentially breaks the HMC or the MDL.

Data was pulled on 6 December 2023. The original dataset has an overall 8 million records; our dataset has 2 years of information, from 6 December 2021 to 6 December 2023.
